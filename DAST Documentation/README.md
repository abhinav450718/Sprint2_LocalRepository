# 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) implemented as part of Continuous Integration (CI) security checks for Python-based attendance and notification services. It explains the purpose, workflow, tools, comparison, advantages, best practices, and recommendations for implementing DAST in the CI pipeline.

Attendance and notification services are critical backend systems that handle sensitive operational and user-related data. Ensuring these services are secure is essential to prevent vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, injection attacks, and API exploitation.

DAST enables automated runtime security testing of the application by scanning the running service and identifying vulnerabilities before deployment. Integrating DAST into the CI pipeline ensures secure application deployment, improves system reliability, and strengthens overall application security.

# 2. What is DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing method that analyzes a running application to identify vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attack scenarios.

Unlike static testing, DAST tests the application externally without accessing the source code.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature                 | Description                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Runtime Testing         | Tests running application              |
| Black-box Testing       | No source code access required         |
| Vulnerability Detection | Identifies runtime vulnerabilities     |
| Automated Testing       | Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines |

DAST helps identify vulnerabilities in deployed Python applications such as attendance and notification services.
