## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Buildpiper platform, including its purpose, workflow, advantages, and best practices. It serves as a reference for understanding how Buildpiper automates the application build and deployment process within the software delivery lifecycle.

Buildpiper is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform that enables automated execution of application pipelines based on predefined workflows. It integrates with version control systems and executes structured pipeline stages such as build, validation, and deployment to ensure consistent and reliable application delivery.

This approach enables automated and controlled deployment of applications, reduces manual intervention, improves deployment reliability, and ensures consistency across environments. It supports governance, traceability, and operational efficiency by standardizing the build and deployment process through automated pipelines.
